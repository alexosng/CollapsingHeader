**Obsolete**:
With the Design Support Library announced during IO15 comes the [CollapsingToolbarLayout](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/CollapsingToolbarLayout.html) which is much more powerful, elegant and easier to use. Use it!

# CollapsingHeader
It's like an Android ToolBar reacting to a scroll listener, but not quite.

This is a sample showing how to make a list `headerView` looking like it is part of the `ToolBar` and fade out its content when 
the user starts scrolling.
I wrote a [blog post](http://arnaud-camus.fr/material-design-extended-toolbar-and-scrolling/) explaining each step of the process.
